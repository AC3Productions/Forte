# Forte
My personal Game Engine project. My goal is to make a robust--yet relatively simple--2D game engine, that I can use to make some games I would like to make.

Built using primarily the [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) API and the C++ wrapper for it called [raylib-cpp](https://github.com/RobLoach/raylib-cpp).

I don't have great documentation set up right now, but I've got some [planning documents](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ai30HvYfZC6wlu0aUiFEM8rwssnmpg) for the architecture as well as a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/hHwPugIz) for task tracking.
